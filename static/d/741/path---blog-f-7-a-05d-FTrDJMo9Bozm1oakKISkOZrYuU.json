We've helped many of our customers and partners in all industries to model software to their needs and unique business processes. To meet the desire for flexibility, we see a growing demand for openness and modern architecture in this space. That's why we decided to spin out the development of our new extension framework, Kyma, in open source. We’d like to encourage all of you to take a look, get involved and lend a hand to expand Kyma to cover even more exciting extension scenarios.</p>\n<p>The ideas and concepts in Kyma are a result of long years of customizing different SAP and Hybris solutions. It lets you create serverless applications, mashups and micro services – all running on the underlying Kubernetes+Istio as the foundation of Kyma. </p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://github.com/knative\">Knative</a> comes into the picture. Build from the ground up to support container-based and cloud-native applications – it provides building blocks for developers to build and deploy container-based serverless applications anywhere on Kubernetes. Sounds familiar, right? We were super excited to see that the Knative dev team has taken very similar technology decisions like we did for Kyma. It felt like a validation of our scenario as well as the technology vision. From this point on it was clear that Kyma and Knative were bound to grow together. We have refactored Kyma completely to leverage the Knative configuration, build and serving components right from the start. </p>\n<p>This gives us the chance to focus Kyma on higher-level application connectivity and service consumption scenarios, relying on Knative for the low-level infrastructure.\nWe strongly believe in open technologies and open collaboration. Our goal is to join forces with interested parties out there and to build the most flexible extension framework to get any SaaS application customized and extended.  </p>\n<p>Sounds interesting?
